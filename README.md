## Temperature Conversion Program

A user-friendly temperature conversion tool built using **Pygame**. This project is part of a task for the **Prodigy Infotech Internship**. It demonstrates the integration of GUI components, interactive elements, and dynamic animations.

### Features

- **Interactive Input Methods**:
  - Enter temperature values directly in the text field.
  - Drag or click on the horizontal slider to set temperature values.
- **Real-Time Conversion**:
  - Converts the input temperature in Celsius to **Fahrenheit** and **Kelvin** dynamically.
